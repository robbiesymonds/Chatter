## 💬 Exporting Messenger

Once you [download your data from Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/dyi) (I recommended deselecting everything except Messenger and choose low-quality media for fastest processing). The files you are looking for are named `message_[X].json`, these will be uploaded to the app. (at the time of writing this is how Facebook gives it to you).

> Note: No data is stored anywhere on Chatter, it's all in-browser. This also goes for the sentiment analysis, which is done offline thanks to the [AFINN-165](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/pubs/6010-full.html) to keep your data secure (at the expense of complexity).

## 👨‍💻 Sharing with Friends

It's tedious to share your exported data for various reasons, instead you can enable a "static viewing" mode so that they can experience it without needing to upload anything.

**Recommended Approach:**

1. Fork this repository into a private repo.
2. Add your `message_[X].json` files into the `data` directory (no sub-folders).
3. Modify the `app.tsx` file and set the `STATIC_MODE` variable to `true`.
4. Run the `yarn build` or `npm run build` command to generate the static files.
5. Upload the contents of the `dist` directory to wherever you like!

> **Note:** Most platforms, like [Vercel](https://vercel.com), can be used to host your static files for free.
